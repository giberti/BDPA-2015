# 2014-2015 Final Project

### Overview

> Spring is here, and its time to bring out the bicycles to have some fun! The best part about organizing a Bicycling Club is everyone wants to ride.  So, for this project youâ€™ll create an online shared site that contains knowledge and Tips on Bicycles, Routes, etc.

### Why write code this way?

Students in this class were exposed to some basic HTML, PHP, jQuery, Boostrap, CSS, MySQL and JavaScript. This project attempts to show the students that a fully functional website can be coded with only tools they already have access to.
