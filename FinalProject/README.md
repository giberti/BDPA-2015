# 2014-2015 Final Project

### Overview

> Spring is here, and its time to bring out the bicycles to have some fun! The best part about organizing a Bicycling Club is everyone wants to ride.  So, for this project youâ€™ll create an online shared site that contains knowledge and Tips on Bicycles, Routes, etc.

### Why write code this way?

Students in this class were exposed to some basic HTML, PHP, jQuery, Bootstrap, CSS, MySQL and JavaScript. This project attempts to show the students that a fully functional website can be coded with only tools they already have access to.

It also reflects approximately 6 hours of work. Students were split into groups of 4-6 people and given 3 weeks (6 hours in class) to work on their project. 

The good news about all of this is it will run on PHP 5.3 and MySQL 4.1 and most likely above it's been tested on PHP 5.6 and MySQL 5.5 

### Disclaimer

This code is *not* ready for production use and shouldn't be considered safe from vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities such as XSS and more exist in this code, despite some light efforts to avoid it. 

There are obviously better ways to do all of this, but the point was demonstrate what can be accomplished. Through the history you can see the re-learning involved using `mysql_*` procedural calls vs a more modern object oriented php.
